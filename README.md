## Specification

Our program is a scheduling and social application for University of Toronto students. Students can create an account for themself, which has a unique associated username and password. They can then input their own schedule, specifying whether an event is for a class, for a social event, for a fitness event, or for other academic events. This schedule gets saved so that a user can later log in on a different device and still access their schedule. If the user chooses to input a class event, the program can provide a list of lecture sections that the user may choose from to get those lecture times automatically filled in.

The program will show the user’s schedule on a calendar on the app's main page. Users can “share” their schedules with others that they are friends with, which means they have sent a friend request to that other user and the other user has accepted it. By sharing their schedules, users can see what times others are not available, to help them more easily figure out when they could meet with each other.

The program will also provide a recommendation feature. Users may leave suggestions of various locations around or near campus that may serve as good places to study, eat, get coffee, etc., and other users can leave reviews on the suitability of these suggestions.
