## Specification

We will create a schedule app for University of Toronto students.
Students can make an account with an associated username/password.
Users can input their schedule and share their schedules with others of their choosing based on username.

By sharing their schedules, users can see what times others are not available -- events for which they are not available may be lectures, extracurriculars, tutorials, etc.

The app will show the user's schedule on a calendar on the app's main page, and a user will be able to select other schedules that have been shared with them to see for what time slots both / all people are available, i.e., where there are no schedule conflicts.
